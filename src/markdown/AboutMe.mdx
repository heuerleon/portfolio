# About Me

I am a young software developer with a passion for programming since I was only 10 years old. I like to write server-side Minecraft mods with Kotlin and MongoDB as database. I also have experience with the scripting languages TypeScript and the frontend library React. In the past, I have used Rust in a professional environment for backend development.

At the moment, I am doing a dual study programme in applied computer science at [OTTO](https://www.otto.de/), Germany's second largest online retailer. Currently, I work in full-stack development for serving customer benefits. In my free time, I develop server-side mods for the [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) server [SkyCave](https://github.com/skycavemc), where thousands of players have already used what I developed.

If you're interested in what I do, feel free to take a look at my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/heuerleon?tab=repositories) or my [projects](#featured) listed below.
