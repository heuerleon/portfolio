# About Me

My name is Leon Heuer and I am a young software developer with a passion for programming since I was only 10 years old. I am actively writing desktop applications with C# and server-side mods for Minecraft with Java and Kotlin, utilizing MongoDB as database management system. I also have experience with the scripting languages TypeScript and Python, as well as the frontend library React and the framework Svelte.

At the moment, I am doing a dual study in applied computer science at [OTTO](https://www.otto.de/) where I currently work on the OTTO App. In my free time, I develop server-side mods for a [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) server called [SkyCave](https://github.com/skycavemc), where thousands of players have already used what I developed.

If you're interested in what I do, feel free to take a look at my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/heuerleon?tab=repositories) or my [projects](#featured) listed below.
